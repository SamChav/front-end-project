<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
<br>
Well, I must say I definitely know more about what I don't know. I restarted my page 3 times on the first day of this project. From scratch. First I thought I'd use ThreeJS to make a nice solar system model where the user could click on the planets and bring up the information. I couldn't get the librarys to work, and even if I had got them to work the first day I don't think I could have implemented my fetch and event handlers and search bar all in one more day. Time management combined with real expectations is what I could have done better here. Also, I'd like to add, I really wish I had time to use a library like threeJS or animeJS on this project. I'm out of time.
